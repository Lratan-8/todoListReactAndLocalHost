# A to do list using React js and local storage


## This app was build using react js and some icons from flaticons.com were used.

It contains an input box where you will add your items that you want to do.
After typing your notes just click on the add button given at the right side of the box,
or press enter/return button.

The newly created task will be added to the list below and will be in green background color.

When you will click on the todo item from the list, it will mark the item as completed and will move to the
bottom of the list of items that you created.

Note - the completed items are denoted by red colored background.

The items are stored in the local storage so they won't will stay there in the list,
even when the browser is closed.

TO RESET all the items from the list, there is a reset button on the top right corner of the viewport. By clicking on this button all the items from the list will be cleraed out the and you will get a fresh state of the list.

--THANK YOU--
